# 🚀 My JavaScript Learning Journey! 🌟  

Welcome to my repository, where I document my adventure into JavaScript! This README will guide you through my progress, examples, and learning resources.  

## ✨ What You'll Find Here  

- **Project Demos** – Small examples demonstrating key JavaScript concepts.  
- **Code Snippets** – Handy JavaScript code snippets.  
- **Learning Notes** – Short notes on key concepts.  
- **Practice Examples** – Simple implementations of core topics.  

## 🗺️ My Learning Journey So Far  

### 🔹 JavaScript Basics  
- Understanding **Execution Context**  
- Differences between **`const`**, **`let`**, and **`var`**  
- **Event Loop** mechanism  

### 🔹 Working with Data  
- **Array Methods** – `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `reduce()`, etc.  
- **Object Methods** – Accessing and modifying object properties  

### 🔹 Backend Concepts  
- **Filesystem Module** – Reading, writing, appending, unlinking, checking file stats, and verifying file existence using Node.js.  
- **JWT Authentication** – Basics of JSON Web Tokens, including generating, refreshing, verifying tokens, and handling permissions  
- **Express.js** – Creating a simple server, handling requests, and implementing CRUD operations with middleware
- **RESTful APIs** – Creating a simple server, handling requests, and implementing CRUD operations with middleware  

## 📂 Project Highlights  

Here are some example projects I’ve created:  

- **Variable Scope Demo** – Illustrating `var`, `let`, and `const` behavior.  
- **Array Methods in Action** – Examples of `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()` and `reduce()`. 
- **Object Operations** – Accessing and modifying object properties.  
- **File Handling with Node.js** – Performing read, write, append, delete (`unlink`), check file stats (`stat`), and file existence validation using the `fs` module.  
- **JWT Authentication System** – Implementing JWT authentication with token generation, refreshing, verification, and permission-based access control.  
- **Express.js CRUD API** – Building a basic Express.js server with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and middleware handling.  
- **REST API with Middleware** – Developing a RESTful API with proper HTTP methods, request validation, error handling, and middleware for authentication.   

## 📚 Resources I Used  

I learned JavaScript from various online platforms, including:  

- **W3Schools** – [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)  
- **GeeksforGeeks** – [www.geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-tutorial/)  
-  **MDN Web Docs** – [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)  
- **TutorialsPoint** – [www.tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/index.htm)  
- And other online resources!  

## 🛠️ How to Run My Examples  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Manoj-Developer360/JS.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd [project-folder]
   ```
3. Run the example files:  
   ```sh
