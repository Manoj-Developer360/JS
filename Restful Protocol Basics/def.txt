RESTful web services support total client-server separation. 
They simplify and decouple various server components so that each part can evolve independently
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, not a protocol itself, 
that relies on HTTP for communication and uses principles like client-server architecture, statelessness, and a uniform interface


HTTP Methods in REST:

RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (verbs) to perform operations on resources: 
GET: Retrieves a representation of a resource.
POST: Creates a new resource.
PUT: Replaces an entire resource.
PATCH: Partially modifies a resource.
DELETE: Deletes a resource.
